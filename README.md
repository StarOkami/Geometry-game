# Geometry game
This is a game I am making based on a video called Animation vs. geometry by Alan becker.
The premise of this game is you build shapes and discover different geometry terms which lets you do even more stuff with geometry.
If you want to know what it is going to look like, watch the video Animation vs. Geometry in youtube.
